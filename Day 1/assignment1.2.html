/* Q3: Write a brief intro on available datatypes in javascript?
Ans:
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.
 
1. The String Data Type:
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.
Example:
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes

2. The Number Data Type
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).

Example:
var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425

3. The Boolean Data Type:
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:

Example:
var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program
